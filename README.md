# Predictive Sales Forecasting Dashboard for Optimized Resource Allocation

## Overview

This project develops an interactive dashboard that forecasts future sales performance.  Leveraging historical sales data and market trends, the dashboard provides insights to enable proactive resource allocation, ultimately maximizing profitability. The analysis incorporates time series forecasting techniques to predict future sales figures and visualize key performance indicators.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries used here, e.g., scikit-learn, statsmodels]

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Dashboard:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will generate the sales forecast and display the interactive dashboard.  [If applicable: Specify how to interact with the dashboard, e.g., via a web browser].

## Example Output

The script will produce the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis including key statistics and forecast summary.  This might include details about the forecasting model used, accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE), and predicted sales figures for specific future periods.
* **Dashboard:** An interactive visualization (e.g., using a library like Plotly or a similar dashboarding framework) displaying sales trends, forecasts, and potentially other relevant KPIs (e.g., sales by region, product category, etc.).
* **Plot Files (Optional):**  The script may generate static plot files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `forecast_accuracy.png`) visualizing specific aspects of the analysis for further review.  These files will be saved in the project directory.
